# notebooks-python
A large collection of miscellaneous Jupyter notebooks

Most of these are not fit for public consumption, but here they are anyway!

# index
**art/**: Visually appealing experiments; if I find my old algorithmic-art projects they'll go here
**codes/**: Ciphers, alphabets, Unicode, etc (not cryptography)
**corpora/**: A few text corpora
**lasers/**: Code for SVGs for a laser cutter; final output exists at my house
**math/**: Mostly little problems that grabbed my attention. Lots of probability, some number theory, some geometry, some Conway's Game of Life
**misc/**: Silly or unclassifiable things: video games, a puzzle hunt, the "cubic model" for COVID epidemiology
**ml/**: Machine learning, but mostly small amounts of scratch-work (real work lives elsewhere)
**utilities/**: Useful tools (only one so far)

# best of
**art/sim-anneal.ipynb**: simulated annealing on random colors
**codes/hexrunes.ipynb**: weird glyphs to represent hexadecimal
**lasers/dragon.ipynb**: knobbly pieces that fit together into the dragon fractal
**math/ramsey/**: probabilistic heuristics for Ramsey numbers
**math/cube-puzzle.ipynb**: solving a metal geometry puzzle the "easy" way
**misc/foodclub.ipynb**: over-optimizing a Neopets betting game
**ml/gpt-viz/**: visualizing the size of GPT models (not quite in terms of param count)
**utilities/hexbin.ipynb**: a scatterplot where data is sparse, a heatmap where it's dense
