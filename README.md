# notebooks-python
A large collection of miscellaneous Jupyter notebooks

Most of these are not fit for public consumption, but here they are anyway!

## index

**art/**: Visually appealing experiments; if I find my old algorithmic-art projects they'll go here

**codes/**: Ciphers, alphabets, Unicode, etc (not cryptography)

**corpora/**: A few text corpora

**lasers/**: Code for SVGs for a laser cutter; final output exists at my house

**math/**: Mostly little problems that grabbed my attention. Lots of probability, some number theory, some geometry, some Conway's Game of Life

**misc/**: Silly or unclassifiable things: video games, a puzzle hunt, the "cubic model" for COVID epidemiology

**ml/**: Machine learning, but mostly small amounts of scratch-work (real work lives elsewhere)

**utilities/**: Useful tools (only one so far)

## best of

**art/sim-anneal.ipynb**: simulated annealing on random colors

**art/unicursal.ipynb**: counting unicursal stars and sorting by symmetry

**codes/hexrunes.ipynb**: weird glyphs to represent hexadecimal

**codes/o-utfe.ipynb**: implementing the worst Unicode format I know of

**codes/quines.ipynb**: quines under various restrictions (e.g. no string literals)

**lasers/dragon.ipynb**: knobbly pieces that fit together into the dragon fractal

**lasers/penrose.ipynb**: self-similar fractal Penrose tiles

**math/ramsey/**: probabilistic heuristics for Ramsey numbers

**math/cube-puzzle.ipynb**: solving a metal geometry puzzle the "easy" way

**misc/foodclub.ipynb**: over-optimizing a Neopets betting game

**ml/gpt-viz/**: visualizing the size of GPT models (not quite in terms of param count)

**ml/shwep/**: transcribing podcast episodes conveniently

**utilities/hexbin.ipynb**: a scatterplot where data is sparse, a heatmap where it's dense
